/**
 * Controls the writing of events and properties to the queue to be dispatched to
 * the client.
 * 
 * When writing property values and events to the queue for asynchronous delivery,
 * the values and events may or may not need to be replayed in a specific order.  For
 * example, a simple and low-cost implementation could set all property values and then 
 * fire all events in the order they were received, amalgamating duplicate values and 
 * events into one.  A more complicated and expensive version would replay them in
 * the exact order, including duplicate values etc.
