<h1>Contributing to Standard Libraries</h1>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>
In progress...<br><br>
Advanced features of the JSDT are highly dependent on the accuracy of the libraries.  The good news is that 
these libraries are nothing but Javascript. All of the Classes, inheritence and objects are stubed-out in the 
standardized Javascript prototype structure.  The Javascript Inference Engine uses JsDoc supplied in the
libraries to determine return types, and class hierarchy.
<br><br>
So how can you help?  Well if you find an error in the library objects/JsDoc fix it! For now you
will have to open a bug<b><small>**</small></b> but we hope to make the libraries editable via a wiki in the near future.
<br><br>
When opening a bug, please be sure your changes are as accurate as possible.  This includes the prototype
structure as well as any JsDoc to acompany it.
<br><br>
To locate most installed core libraries, check in your Eclipse workspace 
under <br><i>/[workspaceroot]/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.core.libraries/</i>
<br><br>
Please include the  line number for your library change/suggestion as well as the before and after copy of
your change.
<br><br>
<b><small>**</small></b><small>To open a bug, naviage to the Eclipse homepage at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" TARGET="_blank">www.eclipse.org</a>, and click on the bugs link.  
There should be documentation on obtaining a Bugzilla account there.  You must open the bug under Web Tools project wst.jsdt component.</small>
