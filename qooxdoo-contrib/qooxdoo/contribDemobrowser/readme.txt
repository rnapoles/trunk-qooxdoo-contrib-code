Contrib Demobrowser
=============================================

This application is a facade for qooxdoo's demobrowser. It is able to build and 
display the demos of all libraries in a repository (e.g. qooxdoo-contrib) that 
meet certain criteria. Namely, the library's structure must correspond to that 
of a contrib skeleton and have a valid Manifest file.
In addition to these prerequisites, specific libraries can be selected by 
editing config.demo.json.
