===== Weida =====

==== How to install ====

The installation of Weida is quite simple, but remember two things:

1. Weida was developed under Linux. The build process should be problematic 
because of cygwin for now. 

2. Weida was, until now, only tested under Firefox 2.0. Don't expect a perfect
working version on other browser for now ;)


Ok, now the the only important point:
You need an Webserver with php, I use apache. Place Weida inside an external 
accessable directory of that webserver.

After that you need to the file config/config.xml.example and save the 
result as config/config.xml

You need to change the following entries there:

<projectPath>   
The projects you will create and edit will be saved in this directory. 
IMPORTANT: Must be writeable and accessable by your webserver!

<backendURL>
The relative url to the backend dir. Try it with ../../backend/

<projectURL>    
The url to the data in <projectPath>. Can be a local dir (file:///home/...) or 
via the webserver

The rest should be easy and working :)
