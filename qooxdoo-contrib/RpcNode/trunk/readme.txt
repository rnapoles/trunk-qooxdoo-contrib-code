RpcNode contribution
=========================

This is a json-rpc server based on the JavaScript-based node.js runtime.

The server will implement json-rpc specs 1.0 and 2.0 and be backwards-compatible
to the existing, non-standard json-rpc servers in qooxdoo-contrib.

The code is currently being worked on and still unfunctional.
