qoodoo component library
========================

A qooxdoo-compatible javascript library tightly interoperating with
a (PHP) json-rpc backend, providing features  that are commonly needed 
for web  application development.

This tag is intended for current users of the library which do not 
want to upgrade to the vastly modified trunk. It is not a release!
