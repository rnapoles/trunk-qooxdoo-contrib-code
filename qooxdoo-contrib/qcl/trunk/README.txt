qoodoo component library
========================

A qooxdoo-compatible javascript library tightly interoperating with
a PHP json-rpc backend, providing features  that are commonly needed 
for web  application development.

The trunk version will work with qooxdoo 0.8 / QxTransformer 0.4 / PHP4/5 and supports:

- Access control on client and server
- Centralized clipboard support
- Application state saved in the browser hash
- A databinding mechanism based on the qooxdoo databinding architecture
  extended to the server and based on event propagation
- A couple of components that you can reuse for your application
- A PHP backend which provides database abstraction, model-controller
  architecture and ruby-on-rails-like "active record" database modeling.
  
The code is still in transition and not fully ported to  qooxdoo 0.8 /
 QxTransformer 0.4 / PHP 5.
