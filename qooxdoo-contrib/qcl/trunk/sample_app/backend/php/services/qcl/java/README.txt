The PHP-Java bridge is brought to you by the fine people at 

http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/pjb/

They did a GREAT job.

Quick installation instructions:

WINDOWS:

1) copy extension/{PHP-Version}/php_java.dll into the php extension directory
2) copy extension/JavaBridge.jar into the extension directory
3) edit the [java] section of the php.ini file and change the paths so that
   PHP can find your Java VM

You can also deploy the JavaBridge as a WAR in a Tomcat server, see instructions
here:

We just USE this extension, we know absolutely nothing about it.

Thanks!
