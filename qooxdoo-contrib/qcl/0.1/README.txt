qoodoo component library
========================

A qooxdoo-compatible javascript library tightly interoperating with
a PHP json-rpc backend, providing features  that are commonly needed 
for web  application development.

Currently, this means:

- Access control on client and server
- Centralized clipboard support
- Application state saved in the browser hash

... much more ...

Currently, only qooxdoo 0.7 /QxTransformer 0.3 is supported, but support
for qx 0.8 and qxt 0.4 is underway.
