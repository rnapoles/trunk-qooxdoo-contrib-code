===== OpenAjaxGadgets =====

A demonstration of qooxdoo applications that can be used as gadgets in mashup
applications implementing OpenAjax Alliance standards such as the OpenAjax 
Hub[1] and the OpenAjax Widget Metadata Specification[2].

Contains a publisher gadget that sends messages over the Hub and a receiver
gadget that displays them.

These gadgets have been tested using the OpenAjax Alliance Reference 
Implementation[3].


===== Installation =====

This section assumes that you've successfully set up and configured the OpenAjax
Reference Implementation (AKA the Sample Mashup Application).

1. Use qooxdoo's create-application.py to prepare a new skeleton. Use qxpub as
   the application name.
  
2. Copy the contents of qxpub from your OpenAjaxGadgets SVN checkout into your
   application directory, overwriting any files already present.
  
3. Run generate.py build to create the deployment version of qxpub.

4. Copy qxpub_oam.xml into your application's newly created build directory

5. Create a symbolic link to your qxpub/build application directory in the 
   Sample Mashup App's gadgets directory (e.g. 
   /var/www/openajax-svn/gadgets/trunk/samples/gadgets) using qxpub as the link
   name. (You could of course just create a new directory and copy the contents 
   of the build directory, but you'd have to do it again each time you made any
   changes to the application.)    
  
6. Run your OpenAjax Widget Repository's install script again to make sure the
   new application is added to the widget database.
  
7. Repeat steps 1-6, substituting qxrec for qxpub.  

If all went well, you should be able to add the two new gadgets to a mashup in
the Sample Mashup Application and send messages from one to the other.
