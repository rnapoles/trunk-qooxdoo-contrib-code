Dialog contrib
==============

The Dialog project provides many often-used widgets required in user
interaction, such as alert, confirm, prompt, and others that simplify
the web developer's daily work. 

In order to use the shortcut commands (dialog.Dialog.alert() etc.), you
need to include a compiler hint in your application:

/* ************************************************************************
#require(dialog.Dialog)
************************************************************************ */
