Show and test usage of an RPC Backend
=====================================

This program tests all of the primitives in the JSON-RPC protocol used by
qooxdoo (the primitives which must be implemented by any conformant backend).
It is also an example of how one can make use of remote procedure calls from a
qooxdoo application.

Each tab runs a different test.
