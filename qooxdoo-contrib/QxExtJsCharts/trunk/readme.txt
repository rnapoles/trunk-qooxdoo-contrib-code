QxExtJsCharts ExtJS 4 Charting Functionality Integration for Qooxdoo
====================================================================

A Qooxdoo wrapper for the excellent Charting functionality available with
Senchas ExtJS 4 toolkit (http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/).

Ext4s charting functions pure javascript and work on all browsers up from
IE6 since they are built on a drawing core with backends for SVG, Canvas and
VML.

Note that ExtJS is released under the GPLv3 license which puts additional
restrictions on your Applications as oposed to the default GPL/EPL licensing
of Qooxdoo ... Sencha (the makers of ExtJS) will be happy to sell you
a commerctial license if you need this.
