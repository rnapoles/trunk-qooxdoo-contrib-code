templates
  When specifying the options for a class, it might be nice to be able to save
  those options as a template so that future instantiations of the same class
  can be easily configured with the same options. One way to implement this
  would be to dynamically create subclass that has the templated options.

widget and source outlines
  Mousing over an item in the Application tree should (optionally?) highlight
  the associated widget if the Live Application view is selected; or highlight
  the associated block of code if the Source view is selected.

example applications
  In addition to simple snippets, qooxit could provide entire example
  applicaitons in qooxit tree format, so users can gain experience in
  manipulating qooxit to their needs.
