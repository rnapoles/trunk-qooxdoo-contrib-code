INFORMATION

This module provides various pieces to utilize Selenium
(http://www.openqa.org/selenium) to automate qooxdoo applications.

One part of the project contains a simple Skeleton-like application
that includes a widget ("SeleniumShell.js") to send remote commands to itself
(via the Selenium RC server). In order to make use of this, the application has
to run under Selenium RC control (http://www.openqa.org/selenium-rc).

Another part of the project contains various pieces that add qooxdoo support
to Selenium.
