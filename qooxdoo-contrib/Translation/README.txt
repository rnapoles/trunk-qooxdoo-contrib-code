===== Translation =====

This project provides an infrastructure for volunteers to translate the  
language-specific parts of qooxdoo, i.e.

  * framework
  * feedreader
  * showcaseXXX

The data to be translated has originally been extracted from the JavaScript 
source code. It is in English and is provided in form of a "po" file for each 
language (or locale). For conveniently translating a "po" file you can use one 
of the native applications ("po editors"). For more info please consult 
http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/0.7/internationalization

If you like to help with updating existing translations or adding new 
languages/locales please contact translation@qooxdoo.org

Thanks a lot for your support!
