What you somehow managed to obtain is this: I got the soap client from 
http://www.codeplex.com/JavaScriptSoapClient/ and integrated it 
(as best as i could) to qooxdoo (qooxdoo.org). There is still some work to 
be done, but it seems to work as it is. 

Tested with CherryPy 3.1 and soaplib-lxml from http://github.com/plq/soaplib-lxml/tree/master
on Python 2.5.2, and with Qooxdoo 0.8.2.

Run:

	python wsdaemon.py

and wait for the 

	http://0.0.0.0:7789/

line to appear. Then navigate to

	http://localhost:7789/client/source/

and you should see the main screen which is a toolbar with two buttons on the 
right. 

Known issues:
- table widget makes lots of unnecessary requests before showing the data. 
  see http://www.nabble.com/RmoteTable-fires-_loadRowCount%28%29-multiple-times-for-very-1st-request-td16628238.html#a16628238

- table gets the row count correctly, but can't properly adjust scrollbar range to 
  that value.

Make yourself home and send any questions/comments/patches to

The work here is released under BSD license, except the code under "soap" directory.
The original soap client is licensed under the GPL. This is important, as GPL is not
compatible with qooxdoo's licensing. Use at your own risk.

Take Care!
