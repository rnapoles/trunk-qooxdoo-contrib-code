This is an implementation of the SOAP Rpc protocol, from scratch, in javascript. It
doesn't use XPath, as XPath support is found to be problematic in webkit-based 
browsers.

Tested with CherryPy 3.1 and soaplib-lxml from http://github.com/plq/soaplib-lxml/tree/master
on Python 2.6.2, and with Qooxdoo 0.8.2 and up.

Preparing the client
-----------------------

Unpack a qooxdoo distribution in the qooxdoo folder, or create symlinks to one.
It has to be there so your web browser can find it via the included web server.
Then run ./generate.py source in the client folder and generate the client 
loader script.

You can alternatively put qooxdoo anywhere you want, run ./generate.py build
and point the staticFolder variable to its output. This means editing 
wsdaemon.py

Preparing the server
-----------------------

Chdir to the project directory (same as this README file) and run:

        git clone git://github.com/jkp/soaplib.git ~/soaplib
        export PYTHONPATH=~/soaplib-lxml
        python wsdaemon.py

and wait for the

         http://0.0.0.0:7789/

line to appear. Then navigate to:

         http://localhost:7789/static/demo/default/source/

and you should see the main screen which is a toolbar with two buttons to the
right.

A note about the license
---------------------------

The work here is released under BSD license, except the  "soap.Parameters"
object. The original soap client is licensed under the GPL. This is important, as GPL is not
compatible with qooxdoo's licensing. Here's what the original author had to say:

Dear Matteo Casati,

I've stumbled upon your Javascript SOAP Client, and thought it would make a
fine addition to Qooxdoo, which is an open source javascript RIA library,
licensed under LGPL/EPL. 

The integration work is mostly done, but we just noticed that CC license
that you use is not compatible with LGPL. [1] [2]

In fact, if you look at the references I cited above, they strongly suggest
not to use a CC license for software. 

So, what are your opinions about this? Would you mind changing the licensing
terms of your library so it is compatible with LGPL? If you prefer to save
yourself from the hassle, you can exceptionally license the library under
LGPL to the Qooxdoo community.

If you contact me with your e-mail address, I can send you the work I've
done as well, in case you want to take a look at it. It would actually help
to have the original author review the code.

Awaiting you feedback.

With my best wishes,
Burak Arslan
