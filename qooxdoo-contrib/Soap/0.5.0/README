What you somehow managed to obtain is this: I got the soap client from 
http://www.codeplex.com/JavaScriptSoapClient/ and integrated it 
(as best as i could) to qooxdoo (qooxdoo.org). It's a work in progress,
so far it works in the limited test environment created here.

Tested with CherryPy 3.1 and soaplib-lxml from http://github.com/plq/soaplib-lxml/tree/master
on Python 2.5.2, and with Qooxdoo 0.8.2.

Preparing the client
-----------------------

Unpack a qooxdoo distribution into client/qooxdoo package. It has to be there so the browser 
can find it via the included web server. Then run ./generate.py source in the client folder
and generate the client loader script.

Preparing the server
-----------------------

Chdir to the project directory (same as this README file) and run:

        git pull git://github.com/plq/soaplib-lxml.git ~/soaplib-lxml
        export PYTHONPATH=~/soaplib-lxml
	python wsdaemon.py

and wait for the 

	http://0.0.0.0:7789/

line to appear. Then navigate to:

	http://localhost:7789/client/source/

and you should see the main screen which is a toolbar with two buttons on the 
right. 

Known issues
---------------

- table widget makes lots of unnecessary requests before showing the data. 
  see http://www.nabble.com/RmoteTable-fires-_loadRowCount%28%29-multiple-times-for-very-1st-request-td16628238.html#a16628238

- objects get reconstructed as arrays.

- array detection is a hack


A note about the license
---------------------------

The work here is released under BSD license, except the  "soapdemo.soap.{Client,Parameters}"
objects. The original soap client is licensed under the GPL. This is important, as GPL is not
compatible with qooxdoo's licensing. Here's what the original author had to say:

Dear Matteo Casati,

I've stumbled upon your Javascript SOAP Client, and thought it would make a
fine addition to Qooxdoo, which is an open source javascript RIA library,
licensed under LGPL/EPL. 

The integration work is mostly done, but we just noticed that CC license
that you use is not compatible with LGPL. [1] [2]

In fact, if you look at the references I cited above, they strongly suggest
not to use a CC license for software. 

So, what are your opinions about this? Would you mind changing the licensing
terms of your library so it is compatible with LGPL? If you prefer to save
yourself from the hassle, you can exceptionally license the library under
LGPL to the Qooxdoo community.

If you contact me with your e-mail address, I can send you the work I've
done as well, in case you want to take a look at it. It would actually help
to have the original author review the code.

Awaiting you feedback.

With my best wishes,
Burak Arslan
