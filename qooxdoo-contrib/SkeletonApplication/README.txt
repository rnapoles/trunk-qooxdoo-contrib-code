===== SkeletonApplication =====

This folder "SkeletonApplication" contains the complete file structure and files 
needed to start a new contribution that has a application-like (!) character. 
It is based on the regular "skeleton" that is recommended as the basis for any 
custom application development with qooxdoo.

If your contribution is not an _application_, but rather a single _widget_ (or a 
set of related widgets), please use the "SkeletonWidget" structure instead, 
which is provided in qooxdoo-contrib as well.

After you copy this "SkeletonApplication" folder and rename it to the name of 
your planned contribution, please replace the content of this README.txt file 
with a description of your own contribution.
