QxTransformer
=============

QxTransformer is an XSLT-based framework for rapid application development with the 
qooxdoo toolkit. It takes care of the most tedious parts of writing applications with 
qooxdoo - GUI building can be done almost entirely without javascript, which is only 
needed for event handling and business logic.
