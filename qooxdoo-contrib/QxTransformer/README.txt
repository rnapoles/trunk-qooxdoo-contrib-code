     QxTransformer
=========================

QxTransformer is a opensource framework providing conversion from a 
transparent XML description of the graphical user interface (GUI) to 
JavaScript code, based on the qooxdoo Ajax application framework.

It is designed to significantly ease the burden of writing web application
in JavaScript and allows automated creation of UI within the regular qooxdoo 
build and deployment process. Additionally, qxtransformer lets you 
concentrate on UI structure description and allows you to switch 
to a new version of a qooxdoo API with a minimum of code-changes.
