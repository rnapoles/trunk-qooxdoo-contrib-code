      <p>Qwt's Qooxdoo module re-packages original Qooxdoo Distribution into a Maven aritfact 
        to make it available for Qwt applications. This is similar to Linux distributions re-packaging
        software distributed in an arbitrary format to make it available in the distributions format. 
        The version number follows the qooxdoo version.</p>
        
      <p>The Qooxdoo module consists of Binding classes, Qooxdoo resources, and Normal Java classes. 
        Binding classes (in <code>qx</code>; one Java class for every Qooxdoo 
        JavaScript class) are generated from Qooxdoo's JavaScript sources and merged with manual patches.
