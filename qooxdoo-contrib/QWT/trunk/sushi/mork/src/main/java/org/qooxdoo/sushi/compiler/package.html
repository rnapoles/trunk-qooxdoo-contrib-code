<p>Invoke and control mork.</p>

<pre>
syntax style
o use brackets with spaces, in order to distinguish them from postfix operators
o right hand side of a rule
  o placement on the same line frequently need re-alligning ::=
  o placement on a new line is less compact
o no explicit start symbol in Mork files
  o placing the scanner section behind the parser section
    implies my symbol ordering
  o temporarily changing the start symbol for testing
    purpose isn't possible because more complains about
    unreachable symbols
  o shorter

<pre>
TODO
o compiled Mapper
  o compiled functions
    o improve code-generation
      o unwraping and casting
      o use local variables instead of operand stack?
      o get rid of some of the copy function calls.
    o hard-wire the option?
  o cleanup "compiler" classes

o mapper.grm improvements
  o remove tailing ";" if lookahead 2 is available
    + ; is irritating
    + no more reformatting if alternatives are added
    + formatting of ";" is difficult:
      o symbol; would be Java-like, but it's problemtic
        with postfix-operators:  symbol+;
  o style consideration
    o 1 line  - a comprehensive spec is needed
    o allign to column 16

o merge parser + scanner section -- automatically separate regular and context-free parts
  o how to invoke semantic functions in the scanner?
  o algorithm
    o goal: collect all symbols to be processed by the scanner
    o init: initialize with identifier symbols and symbols for
            literals
    o step:
      add left-hand-side symbol, if all right-hand-side symbols
      are already contained
  o white space handling
    o declare a set of symbols where special processing is wanted;
      declare white-space removal as special processing
    o white space can become an attribute ...
  o Cocom's tool "MESE" does it
