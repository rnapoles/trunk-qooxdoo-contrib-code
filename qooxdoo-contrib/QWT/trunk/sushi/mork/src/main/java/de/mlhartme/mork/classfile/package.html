<p>Java class files. The primary purpose of this package is compiler
construction, i.e. to simplify code generation. In addition, the package
can be used to dis-assemble class files, which might be usefull for
tools like disassemblers/dumpers, obfuscators, javap, verifiers, class
loaders.  This package has a Main class that demonstrates some of
the features. </p>

<p>The package hides details of class files (namely the constant pool and
the instruction encoding) in order to simplify code generation: I trade
simplicity for control of the generated class file. For example, saving a
classfile previously loaded normally does not necessarily
yield an identical classfile. However, the resulting class file has the
same effect. This philosophy differs from gnu.bytecode and makes it *not*
suitable for exact disassembling.</p>

<p>This package hides the constant pool: users of this package have no
access to the constant pool, it's hidden completely. Note: javac seems to
sort constant pool entries and adds a "LineNummer" utf8 to constant pool,
even if no code attributes occur. This might result in physically different
class files when dumping.</p>

<p>This package hides the instruction encoding: when loading instructions
from a class file, it turns physical into logical instructions. The
physical instruction includes offsets, optimized constants, optimized
local variables references, etc.  The logical instruction does not,
and thus users do now have to care about these details. This encoding (and
decoding when writing logical instructions) is defined by the
InstructionEncoding and InstructionType classes.</p>

<p>Bytecode within class files is not optimized for speed or size. </p>

<p>toString() is implemented to be used in a dumper.</p>

<p>Ref classes stand between descriptor Strings and the corresponding
java.lang.reflect classes:  Descriptor - Ref - reflect.  There is a
bijection between descriptors and Refs. Any reflect object has a corresponding
reference; however, Refs do not necessarily imply a reflect object.</p>

TODO

o features
  o renaming classes
    -> to bootstrap mork
  o TABLESWITCH: fixup start/end argument;
    use this feature in the MapperFunction compiler

o cleanup
  o intructions
    o re-think implementation
    o use primitive values to store int arguments?
  o local variables; allocate or assign?
  o error messages, checks, warning
  o argument and result types in IO
  o constant pool
    o hash for entries to speedup large file processing
    o introduce a "Ref" base class
