The sources for qxdt are in a subversion directory. This requires a plug-in in the building eclipse
 that understands subversion map files.
The SVN plug-in can be fetched from http://sourceforge.net/projects/svn-pde-build/

The qxdt requires at least Ganymede JEE M5 to build against and new JSDT sources
