FlowLayout for qooxdoo 0.8

=== Temporary information ===

This information is for generating the accompanying demo application within  
this qooxdoo-contrib checkout (something you would do during development of 
this contribution):

Suppose there is a qooxdoo 0.8 checkout called qooxdoo.trunk next to the 
checkout of qooxdoo-contrib, execute the following command in your shell from 
within the directory FlowLayout/trunk:

../../../qooxdoo.trunk/tool/bin/generator.py source

This generates the demo application, which can be started by opening 
source/index.html

In addition to 'source', all regular generator targets may be called, e.g. 
'build' or 'api'.
