ExtJS 4 Charting Functionality Integration for qooxdoo

A qooxdoo wrapper for the excellent Charting functionality available with
Sencha's ExtJS 4 toolkit (http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/).

IMPORTANT: 
The ExtJS 4 library code is *not* included with this extension. 
Download the ExtJS4 library and extract the following files into the 
source/resource/ExtJs4/ folder of this contribution: 
ext-all.css, ext-all-debug.js, ext-core-debug.js

The ExtJS 4 charting functions are pure javascript and work on all browsers up
from IE6 since they are built on a drawing core with backends for SVG,
Canvas and VML.

Note that ExtJS is released under the GPLv3 license which puts additional
restrictions on your Applications as opposed to the default LGPL/EPL licensing
of qooxdoo ... Sencha (the makers of ExtJS) will be happy to sell you
a commercial license if you need this.
