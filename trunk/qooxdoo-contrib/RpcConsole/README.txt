RpcConsole
==========

This contribution is a scriptable test client for your JSON-RPC backend. 

It contains an embeddable widget which allows the user to input request data
and see the response returned by the client (rpccconsole.RpcConsole), and a
demo application (rpcconsole.demo.Application), which can be used run tests
manually or by user-supplied scripts. The demo allows to open multiple windows 
with independent consoles, and to load test data from a given url. 

See the released or the trunk versions' readme.txt for details.
