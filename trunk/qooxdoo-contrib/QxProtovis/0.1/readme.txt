Protovis Integration for Qooxdoo
================================

Protovis composes custom views of data with simple marks such as bars and
dots. Unlike low-level graphics libraries that quickly become tedious for
visualization, Protovis defines marks through dynamic properties that encode
data, allowing inheritance, scales and layouts to simplify construction.

Protovis is free and open-source, provided under the BSD License. It uses
JavaScript and SVG for web-native visualizations; no plugin required (though
you will need a modern web browser)!

Although programming experience is helpful, Protovis is mostly declarative
and designed to be learned by example.
