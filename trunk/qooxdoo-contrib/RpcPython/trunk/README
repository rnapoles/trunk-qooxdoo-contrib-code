The RpcPython project provides JSON-RPC backend functionality for
web applications using the qooxdoo library ( http://qooxdoo.org ) or
simply requiring a JSON-RPC compatible datasource.

RpcPython includes and continues the currently unmaintained qxjsonrpc package 
(Original Author: Viktor Ferenczi, see http://python.cx.hu/qxjsonrpc).

===== Usage =====

  * Start the server by "python start-server.py". The server listenes on port 8000. 
    You can configure the port in the start-server.py script. 
  * The server imports service classes and calls the service methods. 
    It receives a service name in dot-separated path format and expect to find the 
    class containing the service in a file. If the service name is "foo.bar.baz", 
    the class is named "Baz" in the "foo.bar.baz" module, located in "foo/bar/baz.py" 
    somewhere on the python class path.
  * The class file is dynamically loaded and the service object instantiated when the 
    request is received (will be done only once for each service object).
  * The classes and methods are protected. The service class is loaded only if the 
    containing module contains the "isRpcService" property set to True and if the 
    method contains the "public" decorator.

Example: 
qooxdoo client calls 

  * service: "qooxdoo.test"
  * method: "echo"
  * params: ["Hello World']

File class/qooxdoo/test.py

from qxjsonrpc import public, fail

# Expose this module as an RPC service 
isRpcService = True

class Test(object):
    
    @public
    def echo(self, v):
        return 'Client said: [ %s ]'%(v,)
