The RpcPython project provides JSON-RPC backend functionality useful for
WEB applications using the qooxdoo library ( http://qooxdoo.org ) or
simply requiring a JSON-RPC compatible datasource.

RpcPython includes and continues the currently unmaintained qxjsonrpc package 
(Origianl Author: Viktor Ferenczi, see http://python.cx.hu), which, however
does not work with the current qooxdoo version. The qxjsonrpc package supports 
REST-style requests (GET & POST) and the python WSGI module. 

In contrast, the code developed in this contrib project aims only at strict
json-rpc compliance as described here:

  http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/Rpc_server_writer_guide
  
This means that REST-style requests are only inofficially supported. The
main protocol implemented is raw json sent by a POST request.

The code is in the process of being ported - it is not functional yet.
