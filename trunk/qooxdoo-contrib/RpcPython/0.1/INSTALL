Installation instructions for RpcPython
=======================================

Requirements:
------------

1. Python 2.4 or 2.5
   The python you use for the qooxdoo toolchain.

2. JSON serializer package
   At least one supported package must be installed. Supported packages:
   - python-cjson-1.0.3x3 (download from http://python.cx.hu)
     The current code works only with 1.0.3, will be ported to newer 
     versions.
   - simplejson: http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/simplejson
   NOTE: python-cjson is MUCH faster, but not pure-python (requires C compiler).

Installation:
-------------
No installation is necessary, the qxjsonrpc library is shipped with this
contrib for easier maintenance and upgrade

Testing:
--------
You can find tests under the services subdirectory. Use the RpcExample
or RpcConsole contrib projects as a frontend to test the python backend.
