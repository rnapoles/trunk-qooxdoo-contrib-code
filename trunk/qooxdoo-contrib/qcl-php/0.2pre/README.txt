qoodoo component library
========================

A qooxdoo-compatible javascript library tightly interoperating with
a PHP json-rpc backend, providing features  that are commonly needed 
for web  application development.

The 0.2 version of the backend works with:

- qooxdoo 0.8-1.0
- PHP4/5 
- MySql >5.0

and features A PHP backend which provides database abstraction,
model-controller architecture and ruby-on-rails-like "active record" 
database modeling.
  
 This version was written to be PHP4-compatible, but PHP4 support has been
 abandoned during development - so some work will have to be put into it
 to reverse PHP5 code. This should not be too difficult, though, mainly 
 interface / implements stuff. Please submit a patch with your changes 
 if do this.
