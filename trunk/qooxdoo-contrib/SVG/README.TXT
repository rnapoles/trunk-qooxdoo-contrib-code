=== SVG ===

== Introduction ==

  This library provides a qooxdoo interface to native SVG graphics. It can be
  used to dynamically create, alter and embed SVG graphics directly into a 
  qooxdoo application.

  The library interface is heavily based on the W3C SVG 1.1 FULL standard and aims
  to provide full support for the various features of the standard, including (but
  not limited to) dynamic scripting, animations and user interaction.

  Before using this library, you should have at least a basic understanding
  of the SVG standard.
