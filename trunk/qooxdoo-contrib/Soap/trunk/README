What you somehow managed to obtain is this: I got the soap client from 
http://www.codeplex.com/JavaScriptSoapClient/ and integrated it 
(as best as i could) to qooxdoo (qooxdoo.org). There is still some work to 
be done, but it seems to work as it is. 

Tested with CherryPy 3.1 and soaplib from svn (r39) patched with given diff,
on Python 2.5.2, and with Qooxdoo 0.7.3

To install and patch soaplib, do the following as root:

	svn co https://svn.optio.webfactional.com/soaplib/trunk/soaplib /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/soaplib
	cp backend/soaplib_r39.diff /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/soaplib
	cd /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/soaplib
	patch -p0 < soaplib_r39.diff

See http://groups.google.com/group/soapliboptio/browse_thread/thread/888a24d7b4f07263

You may have a version of Python other than 2.5.x installed. If 
you're not sure, run:

	python -V

and change the python library path above according to the output.

Install CherryPy as documented in its web site, cherrypy.org

After doing all this, run:

	make 
	python backend/wsdaemon.py

and wait for the 

	http://0.0.0.0:7789/

message to appear. Then navigate to

	http://localhost:7789/static/source/

and you should see the main screen which is a toolbar with two buttons on the 
right. 

Known issues:
- table widget makes lots of unnecessary requests before showing the data. 
  see http://www.nabble.com/RmoteTable-fires-_loadRowCount%28%29-multiple-times-for-very-1st-request-td16628238.html#a16628238

- table gets the row count correctly, but can't properly adjust scrollbar range to 
  that value.

The original soap client is licensed under the GPL. This is important, as GPL is not
compatible with qooxdoo's licensing. Use at your own risk.
