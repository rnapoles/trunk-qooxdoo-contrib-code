==== Soap Module ====

This is a soap rpc module for qooxdoo. The original code comes from:

http://www.codeplex.com/JavaScriptSoapClient/

It's heavily modified because that code seems to be tested only against 
.Net web services. 

I've also added a sample remote table model for convenience.

There is also a soap backend written in python, using a patched version
of soaplib, and a vanilla CherryPy 3.1.

Note that the original soap client was licensed under GPL, which is 
NOT compatible with LGPL, the license that qooxdoo uses. If you use 
this code in your project, you *might* have to open source it all! 
Please consult your lawyer for more precise information.
