==== Soap Module ====

This is a soap rpc module for qooxdoo. The original code comes from:

http://www.guru4.net/articoli/javascript-soap-client/en/

Note that it is originally licensed under Creative Commons License,
which is NOT compatible with LGPL (although it is compatible with EPL).

I've also added a sample remote table model for convenience.

There is also a soap backend written in python, using a patched version
of soaplib, and a vanilla CherryPy 3.1.
