<p>Additional functionality over java.lang.reflect. Provides
wrapper classes that unify methods, constructors and fields in functions.
Some classes in this package use the same name as the wrapped
java.lang.reflect class. The documentation adds the term Java when refering
java.lang.reflect classes </p>

<p>Implementation notes:</p>

<p>Wrapper classes (Method, Constructor, Field) can't derive
the corresponding reflection classes because those are final or have
private constructors.</p>

<p>There is an alternative implementation for Function: its constructur
receives the function signature (name, result, arguments) and maintains them
autonomously. This would prevent derived functions to change the signature
dynamically and it would be slightly faster. However, constructing derived
classes becomes weired, speed is typically not an issue (because type-checking
is performed at compile-time), and it requires more space. The current
solution is somehow cleaner. </p>

<p>I'd like to avoid argument copying by adding an ofs argument to invoke.
But finally, Java methods or constructors will be called - and they need
a shrink-wrapped array.</p>

TODO:
o rename functions into Callable?
  o functions can have side-effects
o Function.getParameterTypes is expensive
o mutable Selections?
o resemble java.lang.reflect naming

o merge with mapping.Type/mapping.Library?
o move classfile.*Ref classes into this package?
o functions and interfaces?
</pre>
