<body>

<p>Implements Xml syntax. Implements most of the XML specification:
XML 1.0 W3C Recommendation Second Editions, 6-Oct-2000. See
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006.html. References (e.g. ยง4.3.2)
in the code or javadoc refer to paragraphs of this specification.</p>

<p>The top-level classes in this package are XmlSyntax and XmlScanner.
They correspond to GrammarSyntax and Grammar scanner for grammar syntax.
An XmlSyntax object represents a DTD; translating it results in a parser
that refers to an XmlScanner object.</p>

<p>To understand this package it's important to distinguish grammar token
and Xml token. Grammar token result from regular expressions taken from a
xml.grm, they are used internally by the XmlScanner that transforms them
into XmlToken like are start- and end token for the underlying DTD, pctext
and the like.
</p>

<p>Note that there is just one Parser class. It can be used for both
grammar parser and Xml parsers. </p>
