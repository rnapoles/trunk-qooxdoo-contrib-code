===== CouchDB =====

This contribution provides client-side access to a CoucbDB server using a REST api.
For this purpose, part of this contribution is also a more generic neutral rest-library.

For more information about CouchDB see:
http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/

Please note that CouchDB itself is still in Alpha state and the api is in flux.
So, it might from time to time lag behind SVN updates of CouchDB. 

Releases of this contribution are therefore tagged by date.
