I'm not yet completely happy with how i've setup the api.

It's esspecially difficult to find an interface that is both trivial to use, yet
flexible enough to deal with all the possible scenario's that can pop up in the 
context of asynchronized requests.

If any one has any suggestions, feel free to email me at:
