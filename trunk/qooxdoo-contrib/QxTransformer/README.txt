QxTransformer
=============

QxTransformer is an open source framework providing conversion from a transparent XML 
description of the graphical user interface (GUI) to qooxdoo JavaScript code. It is 
designed to significantly ease the burden of writing web application in JavaScript and 
allows automated creation of UI within the regular qooxdoo build and deployment process. 
The framework ships with an xml "dialect" which mirrors the qooxdoo object structure, 
but allows to integrate any other xml semantics with an advanced templating system.
