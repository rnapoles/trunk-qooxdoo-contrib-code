     QxTransformer
=========================

QxTransformer is a opensource framework providing conversion from a 
transparent XML description of the graphical user interface (GUI) to 
JavaScript code, based on the qooxdoo Ajax application framework.

It is designed to significantly ease the burden of writing web application
in JavaScript and allows automated creation of UI within the regular qooxdoo 
build and deployment process. Additionally, qxtransformer lets you 
concentrate on UI structure description and allows you to switch 
to a new version of a qooxdoo API with a minimum of code-changes.

The qxtransformer SVN is located at 

https://www.qxtransformer.org/svn/qxtransformer/ (note the "s" in https)

You may want to create a local "SVN external" pointing to this repository, 
if you want to work with the qxtransformer code from within your 
regular qooxdoo-contrib checkout: 
text property "svn:externals" on directory QxTransformer/ with value 
"qxtransformer https://www.qxtransformer.org/svn/qxtransformer/"
