===== QxTransformer =====

QxTransformer is an open source framework providing conversion from a 
transparent XML description of the graphical user interface (GUI) to 
JavaScript code, based on the qooxdoo Ajax application framework.

It is designed to significantly ease the burden of writing web application
in JavaScript and allows for an automated creation of UI within the regular 
qooxdoo build and deployment process. Additionally, qxtransformer allows you 
to concentrate on the UI structure description and also to switch 
to a new version of a qooxdoo API with a minimum of code changes.

The qxtransformer SVN is located at 

https://www.qxtransformer.org/svn/qxtransformer/ (note the "s" in https)

You may want to create a local "SVN external" pointing to this repository, 
if you work with the qxtransformer code from within your regular 
qooxdoo-contrib checkout: 
text property "svn:externals" on directory QxTransformer/ with value 
"qxtransformer https://www.qxtransformer.org/svn/qxtransformer/"
