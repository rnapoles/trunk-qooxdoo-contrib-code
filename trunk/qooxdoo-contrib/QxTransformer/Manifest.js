  "description" : "QxTransformer is an open source framework providing conversion from a transparent XML description of the graphical user interface (GUI) to JavaScript code, based on the qooxdoo Ajax application framework.  It is designed to significantly ease the burden of writing web application in JavaScript and allows for an automated creation of the UI within the regular qooxdoo build and deployment process. Additionally, qxtransformer allows you to concentrate on the UI structure description and also to switch to a new version of a qooxdoo API with a minimum of code changes.",
