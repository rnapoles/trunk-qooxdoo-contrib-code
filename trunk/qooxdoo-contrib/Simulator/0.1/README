DESCRIPTION
The 'source' part of the project contains a simple Skeleton-like application
that includes a widget ("SeleniumShell.js") to send remote commands to itself
(via the Selenium RC server). In order to make use of this, the application has
to run under Selenium RC control (http://www.openqa.org/selenium-rc).

The 'tool' part of the project contains various pieces that add qooxdoo support
to Selenium:

  - a user extension for Selenium Core (adding qooxdoo-specific commands and
    locators; the complete package is available from the Selenium web site,
    http://wiki.openqa.org/display/SEL/qooxdooExtension )
  - language bindings that add support for these commands to the standard
    language bindings that come with Selenium RC (via derived classes)
  - complete test scripts that utilize the Selenium RC API to test existing
    qooxdoo applications

PREREQUISITES
  - a Selenim RC installation (0.9.2 or higher); get it from
    http://www.openqa.org/selenium-rc [mandatory]
  - for building: Java Development Kit (JDK 1.5 or higher); (for .jar handling
    and compilation of the extended client class); make sure to set the
    CLASSPATH separator in Makefile.local [recommended]
    - if you do not plan to use the Java/JavaScript API to Selenium RC, but
      rather the Python bindings, you can actually get away without a JDK, but
      you still have to achieve what the 'selenium-server-ext' target of the
      Makefile achieves: get the qooxdoo server extensions into the server jar
    - but this should be achievable through any other tool that understands the
      zip format (in replacement for JDK's 'jar' utility); check the Makefile
      for what you have to do
  - for running JavaScript based tests: Rhino; get if from
    http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/ [recommended]
  - for running tests against the contained sample app: a local web server
    [optional]

SETUP
  - adapt the settings in Makefile.local to your needs; this covers mainly
    setting up some local paths and some other details about your environment;
    not all settings are mandatory, depending on which make targets you want to
    run (s. the PREREQUISITES and USAGE sections)
  - some of the contained simulation scripts require you to adapt a config
    section at the beginning; see the scripts before running them

USAGE
  - 'make simulator-build-dirs'
    'make selenium-server-ext'  -- these two commands are the minimal targets
    you have to build; this will provide you with a Selenium RC server with
    qooxdoo extensions (under ./tool/script/selenium-server.jar) [required]
  - 'make simulator' -- this covers the previous commands and will create a
    Selenium RC server and Java client driver with qooxdoo support [recommended]
  - 'make selenium-rc-start'  -- starts the custom Selenium RC server in the
    background; if you want to use Selenium RC's interactive shell, replace the
    '&' with '-interactive'; you might choose to start the server by hand
    (rather than  through a make target); however you do it, a Selenium RC
    instance has to be running before any testing can take place; therefore
    [required]
  - 'make run-simulation-showcase'  -- will run a simulation against the
    Showcase application on the qooxdoo web site (you need Internet access for
    this) [optional]
  - 'make [source|build]'  -- this is the usual way to generate the sample
    application contained with Simulator [optional]
  - 'make run-simulation-custom'  -- will run a simulation against this sample
    application; this requires a local web server that exports the files in this
    package; make sure to adapt the settings in the test scripts to your web
    server setup [optional]
  Apart from that, there are a few utility targets which mainly serve to
  illustrate helpful commands (but which you might choose rather not to invoke
  through make):
  - 'make selenium-rhino-shell'  -- this will start an interactive JavaScript
    shell (through Rhino), which also provides the Selenium RC Java bindings
    with qooxdoo support; this requires the 'make simulator' target to be run
    beforehand (s.above) [optional]
