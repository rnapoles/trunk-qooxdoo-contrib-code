Filesize format class
FilesizeFormat cell renderer class

These classes were inspired by qooxdoo classes qx.util.format.NumberFormat and qx.ui.table.cellrenderer.Number.  Thus, Gaetan de Menten and Til Schneider are listed as co-authors.
It should be noted that there are 1024 Bytes in a KB (not 1000).  This nuance is incorporated into the filesizeFormat Class.

As of 4/17/08, a running demo of the app is viewable at sandbox.tartansolutions.com/filesize/build
