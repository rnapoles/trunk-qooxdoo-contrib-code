===== Filesize =====

  * Filesize format class
  * FilesizeFormat cell renderer class

These classes were inspired by qooxdoo classes qx.util.format.NumberFormat and 
qx.ui.table.cellrenderer.Number.  Thus, Gaetan de Menten and Til Schneider are 
listed as co-authors.

It should be noted that there are 1024 Bytes in a KB (not 1000). This nuance 
is incorporated into the filesizeFormat Class.

As of 4/17/08, a running demo of the app is viewable at
