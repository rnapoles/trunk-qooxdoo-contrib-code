QxAdmin README 
==============

(caveat: this is all future stuff, nothing of it is yet implemented!)

ABOUT
-----

QxAdmin is a web-based interface to the qooxdoo SDK. It comes with a tiny web
server and a GUI part that runs in your browser. Through the GUI, you will be
able to

- invoke 'make' on selected parts of the framework and it's applications, or the
  whole framework
- do 'make source', 'make build' etc. on the selected target
- pass further arguments to the make command
- edit the make files, either in a 'raw' fashion (think "notepad"), or a guided
  fashion (through forms)
- check for updates of your installation in svn


INSTALL
-------

In order to use this browser-based build environment, you have to take the
following steps:

1. Unpack this package into the root directory of a qooxdoo SDK installation (in
   other words, to an existing QOOXDOO_PATH on your machine)

2. cd to the subdirectory ./qxadmin/bin

3. Start the tiny web server with 'python qxadmin.py -p <port>', where <port>
   signifies a free port on your local machine. If you leave this parameter out,
   it will default to '8007'.

4. Open your browser and point it to "http://localhost:8007/". This will present
   you with the administrative interface to your qooxdoo installation. For
   security reasons, the web server will only accept connections from the local
   machine, so nobody will be able to connect to it remotely.
