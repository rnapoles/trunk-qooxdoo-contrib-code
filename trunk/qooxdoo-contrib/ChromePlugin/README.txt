=== Chrome ===
This is a set of libraries to provide support for working directly with
features that only the Chrome browser supports - most specificly with
a plugin or extension for Chrome.

Work is begun on this library with Qooxdoo 1.3.  I will attempt to keep
it updated with the latest and most current version of the main library.
