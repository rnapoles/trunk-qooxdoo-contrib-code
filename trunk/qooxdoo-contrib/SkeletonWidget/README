INFORMATION

This folder "SkeletonWidget" contains the complete file structure and files 
needed to start a new contribution that has an widget-like (!) character. 

If your contribution is not a _widget_ (or a set of related widgets), but rather 
a typical application, please use the "SkeletonApplication" structure instead, 
which is provided in qooxdoo-contrib as well.

After you copy this "SkeletonWidget" folder and rename it to the name of 
your planned contribution, please replace the content of this README file with 
a description of your own contribution.
