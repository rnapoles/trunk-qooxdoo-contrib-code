qoodoo component library
========================

A qooxdoo-compatible javascript library tightly interoperating with
a PHP json-rpc backend, providing features  that are commonly needed 
for web  application development.

The trunk version works with:

- qooxdoo 1.* (should work with any version)
- QxTransformer 0.4 (SVN) (optional)

The trunk is currently refactored to use the core-sandbox-module architecture
see

http://www.slideshare.net/nzakas/scalable-javascript-application-architecture

and therefore is changing fast. It is not recommended to use it currently.
