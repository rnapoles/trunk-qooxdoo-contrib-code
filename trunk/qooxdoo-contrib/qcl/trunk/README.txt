qoodoo component library (qxl)
-----------------------------

A couple of interoperating extensions that are useful for web 
application development:

- authentication / gui security
- databinding
(more components to come)

Currently with a PHP/MySQL backend, but others might follow.

You can use the qcl project in two ways.

1) You use the classes in source/qcl/ for your own projects
   by setting the APPLICATION_INCLUDES += contrib://cql 
   
2) You build a full-fledged application modifying and extending the sample 
	 application contained in the sample_app directory. Please refer to the README file
	 there on how to get started (documentation on the qooxdoo website will follow).
