qoodoo component library (qxl)
-----------------------------

A couple of interoperating extensions that are useful for web 
application development:

- authentication / gui security
- databinding
(more components to come)

Currently with a PHP/MySQL backend, but others might follow.

You can use the qcl project in two ways.

1) You use the classes in source/qcl/ for your own projects
   by adding  
   APPLICATION_INCLUDES += contrib://qcl/trunk/frontend
   to your makefile 
   
2) You build a full-fledged application modifying and extending a sample 
	 application that will be added later.
	 
Keep tuned!
