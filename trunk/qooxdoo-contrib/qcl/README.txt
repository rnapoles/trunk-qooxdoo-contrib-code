qoodoo component library 
------------------------

A couple of interoperating extensions that are useful for web 
application development:

- authentication / gui security
- databinding
- clipboard

Currently with a PHP/MySQL backend, but others might follow.

You can use the qcl project in two ways.

1) You use the classes in /frontend/framework/source/qcl/ in your own projects
   by including their path in the makefile's APPLICATION_INCLUDES variable. 
   
2) You build a full-fledged application modifying extending the sample application 
	 contained in /frontend/application/sample_app. Please refer to the README file
	 there on how to get started (documentation on the qooxdoo website will follow).
