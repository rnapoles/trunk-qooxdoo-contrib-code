qoodoo component library
========================

A qooxdoo-compatible javascript library tightly interoperating with
a PHP json-rpc backend, providing features  that are commonly needed 
for web  application development.

Version 0.1 works with qooxdoo 0.7 / QxTransformer 0.3 / PHP4 and supports:

- Access control on client and server
- Centralized clipboard support
- Application state saved in the browser hash
- A simple databinding mechanism that provides data-aware widgets with
  an updateClient() and an updateServer() method
- A couple of components that you can reuse for your application
- A PHP backend which provides database abstraction, model-controller
  architecture and ruby-on-rails-like "active record" database modeling.
  
This version is no longer maintained.
