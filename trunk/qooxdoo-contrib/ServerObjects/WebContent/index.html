				<h1>Qooxdoo Server Objects</h1>
				<p>The server-objects contrib. integrates Java POJO objects on the server with the Qooxdoo client application in a natural and seamless manner.  
				Objects on the server support properties and events, and can fine tune how data is transferred and cached with annotations.  Objects can be passed 
				by value between the client and server which allow (for example) server objects to be bound to a Qooxdoo form without requiring any boiler plate 
				code for communication.</p>
				<p>You can <a href="/qso-0.2.zip">download the source code from here</a> or you can browse or checkout the code from
				SourceForge at 
				<a href="https://qooxdoo-contrib.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qooxdoo-contrib/trunk/qooxdoo-contrib/ServerObjects">https://qooxdoo-contrib.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qooxdoo-contrib/trunk/qooxdoo-contrib/ServerObjects</a>.</p>
				<p><a href="/Overview.pdf">Documentation can be downloaded here</a>, below is an excerpt of the Quick Start guide</p>
				<h3>Sample Applications</h3>
				<p>QSO includes two sample applications – “demoapp” which aims to test every aspect of QSO and report “All tests passed!” at the end, and “explorer” 
				which is a simple file explorer that can navigate a tree of files, loaded on demand and bound to a Qooxdoo form.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>"demoapp" sample: Run the <a href="/demoapp/source/index.html">Source</a> or the <a href="/demoapp/build/index.html">Build</a> version</li>
					<li>"explorer" sample: Run the <a href="/explorer/source/index.html">Source</a> or the <a href="/explorer/build/index.html">Build</a> version</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Defining a Java POJO</h2>
				<p>There is only one basic requirement when defining a POJO on the server – the class or interface must implement com.zenesis.qx.remote.Proxied, 
				after which your methods can be called (synchronously) from the client.  A more useful object will add properties to the class by using the Properties 
				and Property annotations; for example:</p>
				<pre>
@Properties({
	@Property(value="name",event="changeName")
})
public class ServerFile implements Proxied {
	private String name;
	public String getName(){
		return name;
	}
	public boolean rename(String name) {
		...
	}
}
				</pre>
				<p>
				The Property annotation tells the QSO library about the property “name”, that it fires a “changeName” event whenever it is modified, and when 
				QSO copies a ServerFile object from the server to the client, the property value must be delivered at the same time and then cached on the server.  
				If the server changes the value of the property, it will fire a “changeName” event and QSO will relay the new value to the client.</p>
				<p>QSO knows that the “name” property is read only because there is only a getXxxx method, but you can have read-write properties too:</p>
				<pre>
@Properties({
	@Property(value="name",event="changeName"),
	@Property("readOnly")
})
public class ServerFile implements Proxied {
	private boolean readOnly;
	public boolean isReadOnly() { return readOnly; }
	public void setReadOnly(boolean readOnly) {
		this.readOnly = readOnly; }
				</pre>
				<p>In this example, the readOnly property will be defined on the client and the server and QSO will make sure that changes on the client will be 
				copied to the server and vice-versa.</p>
				
				<h2>Properties On Demand</h2> 
				<p>Some properties you only want to get on demand, but once they have been fetched the value should be cached on the client.  For example:</p>
				<pre>
@Properties({
	@Property(value="name",event="changeName"),
	@Property("readOnly"),
	@Property(value="children", onDemand=true, event="changeChildren")
})
public class ServerFile implements Proxied {
	private ServerFile[] children;
	public ServerFile[] getChildren() {
		if (children != null || !file.isDirectory())
			return children;
		
		File[] files = file.listFiles();
		[ ... snip ... ]
		return children;
	}
				</pre>
				<p>Note the “onDemand=true” that’s been added to the @Property definition; the getChildren() method will only be called once by the Qooxdoo 
				client and the result is then cached on the client for future use.</p>
				
				<h2>Connecting the Servlet to the Client</h2>
				<p>Accessing objects on the server is just like any other method call (static methods are not supported) and to call a method you need an object.  
				In QSO, the first object is called a “bootstrap” and is created on demand by QSO; the client application uses the bootstrap object to get everything else.  
				Bootstrap objects are nothing special – they must support the Proxied interface and have a no-args constructor.</p>
				
				<p>Your Java Servlet needs to connect requests coming from the QSO library on the client to the QSO library on the server.  First, choose a 
				URL that is exclusively for QSO to use for your application (e.g. “/explorerServlet/ ajax”) and then add the following code to your doPost 
				method:</p>
				<pre>
ProxyManager.handleRequest(request, response, FileExplorer.class, "fileExplorer");
				</pre>
				<p>The first two parameters are the request and response objects passed to doPost() by the servlet container; the third parameter is the 
				bootstrap class for your application and the fourth is a unique name for the application (it’s used as a key in the HttpSession so make 
				sure it’s unique!)</p>
				<p>In your client app, pass the URL to ProxyManager and then you can call getBootstrapObject() to get an instance of your bootstrap object:</p>
				<pre>
var manager = new com.zenesis.qx.remote.ProxyManager("/explorerServlet/ajax");	
var boot = manager.getBootstrapObject();
				</pre>
				<p>In the “explorer” sample client app, the source code is copied from the Qooxdoo example for virtual trees with a minor addition to get the 
				tree nodes on demand:</p>
				<pre>
tree.addListener("treeOpenWhileEmpty", function(evt) {
	var node = evt.getData();
	var children = node.serverFile.getChildren();
	for (var i = 0; i < children.length; i++) {
		var file = children[i];
		var nodeId;
		if (file.getFolder())
			nodeId = dataModel.addBranch(node.nodeId, file.getName(), null);
		else
			nodeId = dataModel.addLeaf(node.nodeId, file.getName(), null);
		tree.nodeGet(nodeId).serverFile = file;
	};
}, this);
			
// Create the root node
var rootNode = tree.nodeGet(dataModel.addBranch(null, "Desktop", 	false));
rootNode.serverFile = boot.getRoot();
</pre>
				<p>The client code above is pure Qooxdoo – there is no boiler plate code for talking to the server.  The “treeOpenWhileEmpty” event creates 
				new nodes in the tree according to the children returned by ServerFile.getChildren(), and the root node is created by calling the bootstrap 
				object’s getRoot().</p>
