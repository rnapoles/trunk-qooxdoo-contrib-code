===== TableColumnMenuGrid =====

The Table widget's column visibility menu is not scrollable and becomes
truncated if the table height is too small for all of the column names to be
presented in the menu. This alternative column visibility menu presents the
table column names is two columns of the menu: a column for the visible table
column names, and a column for the hidden table column names. The names may be
selected and dragged from one column to the other to affect column visiblity
changes.
